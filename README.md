# Predictive Analytics and Customer Insights: Advanced Machine Learning for Loan Default Risk

**Project By**: Suriya Subbiah Perumal

## üìå Abstract
Traditional credit scoring models often fail in today's dynamic financial landscape. This research improves upon them by integrating advanced machine learning models ‚Äî Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, and ANN ‚Äî with optimization and interpretability techniques. Using the "Bank Loan Defaulter Prediction Hackathon" dataset, models outperformed baseline accuracy by at least 20%. Interpretability tools like SHAP, ALE, and CIME ensured ethical transparency.

## üß† Methodology (CRISP-DM Framework)
### 1. Business & Data Understanding
- Dataset includes borrower demographics, financial status, and loan attributes.
- Key variables: loan amount, interest rate, credit score, home ownership, inquiries, and public records.

### 2. Data Preparation
- **Cleaning**: Removed NAs, handled outliers using Z-scores.
- **Feature Selection**: Lasso regression to identify top predictors.
- **Balancing**: SMOTE for class imbalance.

### 3. Modelling
- Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, ANN, Naive Bayes.
- Tuned using **Bayesian Optimization** and validated via **5-fold Cross-Validation**.

### 4. Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, AUC.

### 5. Interpretability Tools
- **SHAP**: Explains individual predictions using game theory.
- **ALE**: Visualizes effects of features locally.
- **CIME**: Measures contextual importance and utility.

### 6. Ethical Considerations
- Compliance with **GDPR** and fairness audits to mitigate bias.

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis
- **Loan Amount Distribution**: Multimodal peaks suggest clustering.
- **Interest Rate vs Loan Amount**: Shows spread across credit grades.
- **Sunburst Plot**: Correlates ownership type, credit grade, and loan default.
- **Scaled Metric Trends**: Visual comparison across interest rate bins.
- **Recoveries vs Loan Amount**: High recoveries in high-risk loans.
